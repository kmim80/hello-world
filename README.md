# hello-world
Introduction to github
<br>
Miriam here, I completed the html certification and am on my way to get css and javascript. I know a little bit of python too.
It looks like coding is becoing my thing. I'll hopefully become a ux/ui designer or an app developer.
Wish me me luck happy people!....and also stay safe.
